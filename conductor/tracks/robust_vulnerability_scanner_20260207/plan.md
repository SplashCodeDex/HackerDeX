# Plan: Enhanced Robust Vulnerability Scanner & Intelligence Engine

## Phase 1: Architecture & Data Normalization
- [x] Task: Update VulnStore schema to support cross-layer mapping and metadata for 55+ tools b7106f5
- [x] Task: Implement standardized output models (Pydantic) for all major tool categories 13e5a05
- [~] Task: Refactor Parsing Engine to use a plugin-based architecture for tool-specific parsers
- [ ] Task: Implement core parsers for priority tools (Nmap, Nikto, Sqlmap, theHarvester)
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Architecture & Data Normalization' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Prioritization & Correlation Engine
- [ ] Task: Implement the "Advantage-Based" ranking algorithm (Privilege Gain vs. Complexity)
- [ ] Task: Develop the Cross-Layer Correlation logic to link OSINT, Network, and Web findings
- [ ] Task: Create deduplication logic for findings across multiple tools
- [ ] Task: Implement API/CLI views for prioritized vulnerability lists
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Prioritization & Correlation Engine' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: AI Intelligence & Gemini Integration
- [ ] Task: Implement the Gemini-powered Exploit Verification Script generator
- [ ] Task: Develop the Attack Pathing analyzer using LLM correlation
- [ ] Task: Implement the "Next Best Action" engine for autonomous workflow suggestions
- [ ] Task: Create safety filters and sandboxing for AI-generated scripts
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 3: AI Intelligence & Gemini Integration' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 4: Integration & UX Enhancement
- [ ] Task: Integrate the new Intelligence Engine into the CLI menu-driven interface
- [ ] Task: Update the Web UI to display prioritized findings and attack paths
- [ ] Task: Implement end-to-end integration tests for multi-tool scan flows
- [ ] Task: Final documentation update for the enhanced scanning capabilities
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 4: Integration & UX Enhancement' (Protocol in workflow.md)
