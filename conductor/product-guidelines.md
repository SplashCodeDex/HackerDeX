## Visual Identity
- **Cyber-Aesthetic (Dark Mode):** Both CLI and Web interfaces must adhere to a high-contrast dark theme.
- **Color Palette:** Primary background in deep blacks/grays with high-visibility neon accents (specifically Magenta and Cyan) to highlight actions, statuses, and critical data.
